# CS5588: Assignment 2.1

## Model selection

## Dataset

## Results

## How to Reproduce

## Relevance to Project

## Instructions from Canvas

- **Deadline**: September 11 (Wednesday)  
- **Submission Type:** Individual
- **Submission:**
    -   Post all code, data, and results in your individual GitHub repository.
    -   Include the GitHub URL for the reproduced code/model, dataset, and results in the **Assignment 2** submission.

### Objective

As part of Assignment 2, each student must reproduce at least one working deep learning model or LLM solution using a dataset relevant to your project. Up to two students from the same project team may collaborate on this task, but each student must submit their work, including code, data, and results.

### Deliverables

1.  **Model Reproduction**:
    -   Reproduce a deep learning model or LLM using a relevant dataset for your project.
    -   Ensure the model runs successfully and produces results aligned with your projectâ€™s objectives.
    -   If collaborating, the work should be clearly divided, and each student must submit their own results.
2.  **GitHub Submission**:
    -   Post your **code**, **data**, and **results** to your individual GitHub repository.
    -   Ensure the submission includes:
        -   A **README** file explaining the model, dataset, and results.
        -   Clear instructions on how to run the code.
        -   A description of how this model could be applied or adapted to your ongoing project.
    -   Each student must submit their own GitHub URL, even if they collaborated.

### Evaluation

This assignment is **no credit**, but completing it is crucial for building the technical foundation of your project. Each student must ensure their submission is well-documented and the results are reproducible by others, even if collaborating.
